Objective 3: Algorithm
Task 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -,*,/,%)

1.	Set the four operators as input
•	ADDITION (+)
•	SUBTRACTION (-)
•	DIVISION (/)
•	PERCENTAGE (%)
2.	Set the two numbers as input number 1 and number 2
3.	IF the operators is (+) then add the two numbers
ELSE no calculation needed
 PRINT the result of (number 1 + number 2)
4.	IF the operators is (-) then subtract the two numbers
ELSE no calculation needed
 PRINT the result of (number 1 - number 2)
5.	IF the operators is (*) then multiply the two numbers
ELSE no calculation needed
 PRINT the result of (number 1 * number 2)
6.	IF the operators is (%) then the ratio of two numbers is multiplied by 100
ELSE no calculation needed
 PRINT the result of (number 1 / number 2) *100
