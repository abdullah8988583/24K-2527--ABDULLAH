Objective 3: Algorithms
Task 02

•	 Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.


1.	Set a general number (n).
2.	Set a second Nth number which is divisor.
3.	If (n) number is a multiple of Nth number then Nth number is a divisor of n number else it is not a divisor of n number.
4.	After dividing completely by Nth number. The number after which Nth is multiplied to form the n is called the quotient. It is also the answer of our division.
5.	Check the quotient IF it contains digits like (0,2,4,6,8) at unit place it is even else it is odd.
